CS22510 - C, C++ and Java Programming Paradigms
Martin Zokov - mvz

This README file is to describe the contents of my submission for Assignment 1.
There are three main directories:
/C/ -- Contains the C implementation of the task
/C++/ -- Contains the C++ implementation of the task
/Java/ -- Contains the Java implementation of the task

For the C version the source files are as follows:
/C/main.c
/C/stream_handler.h
/C/stream_handler.c
/C/linked_list.c

In order to compile successfully, the Mathemathics standard library should be included.

For the C++ version the source files are as follows:
/C++/main.cpp
/C++/Reader.h
/C++/Reader.cpp
/C++/StreamHandler.h
/C++/StreamHandler.cpp
/C++/Location.h
/C++/Location.cpp

For the Java version the source files are as follows:
/Java/src/cs225/assignment/Main.java
/Java/src/cs225/assignment/Reader.java
/Java/src/cs225/assignment/StreamHandler.java
/Java/src/cs225/assignment/Location.java

The Java implementation was created and built as an Eclipse project.
